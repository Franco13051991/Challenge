Challenge: Rock, Paper and Scissors

This game was made with PHP and web development technologies as HTML and CSS.

I chose this platform for the ability of manipulating files on a server platform.

As soon as the file is uploaded, the file will create the database called: 'db' and it will keep the 

champions with their scores - Every championship represents 3 points.
